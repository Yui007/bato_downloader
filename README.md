## Usage

### Command-Line Interface (CLI)

The CLI is built with `Typer` and provides several commands.

To run the CLI, navigate to the project directory and use `python cli.py [command] [options]`.

*   **Get Manga Info:**
    ```bash
    python cli.py info "https://bato.to/series/143275/no-guard-wife"
    ```
    This command fetches and displays the manga title and the number of chapters. It will also prompt you if you want to list all chapters.

*   **Search Manga:**
    ```bash
    python cli.py search "Solo Leveling"
    ```
    This command searches for manga series matching the query and lists their titles and URLs.

*   **List Chapters:**
    ```bash
    python cli.py list "https://bato.to/series/143275/no-guard-wife"
    ```
    This command fetches and lists all chapters for the given series URL, including their titles and URLs.

*   **Download Chapters:**
    *   **Download all chapters:**
        ```bash
        python cli.py download "https://bato.to/series/143275/no-guard-wife" --all -o "MangaDownloads"
        ```
    *   **Download a specific range of chapters (e.g., chapters 1 to 10):**
        ```bash
        python cli.py download "https://bato.to/series/143275/no-guard-wife" --range "1-10" -o "MangaDownloads"
        ```
    *   **Convert to PDF:** Use the `--pdf` flag to convert downloaded chapters into a single PDF file. By default, original images are deleted after conversion.
        ```bash
        python cli.py download "https://bato.to/series/143275/no-guard-wife" --all --pdf -o "MangaDownloads"
        ```
    *   **Convert to CBZ:** Use the `--cbz` flag to convert downloaded chapters into CBZ (comic book archive) files.
        ```bash
        python cli.py download "https://bato.to/series/143275/no-guard-wife" --all --cbz -o "MangaDownloads"
        ```
    *   **Convert to both PDF and CBZ:** Use both flags to create both formats.
        ```bash
        python cli.py download "https://bato.to/series/143275/no-guard-wife" --all --pdf --cbz -o "MangaDownloads"
        ```
    *   **Keep Images:** Use the `--keep-images` flag along with `--pdf` or `--cbz` to retain the original image files after conversion.
        ```bash
        python cli.py download "https://bato.to/series/143275/no-guard-wife" --all --pdf --keep-images -o "MangaDownloads"
        ```
    *   **Concurrent Downloads:** Control download performance with threading options.
        *   `--max-workers` or `-w`: Maximum concurrent chapter downloads (default: 3)
        *   `--image-workers` or `-iw`: Maximum concurrent image downloads per chapter (default: 15)
        ```bash
        python cli.py download "https://bato.to/series/143275/no-guard-wife" --all --pdf --max-workers 5 --image-workers 20
        ```
    *   **Specify output directory:** Use the `--output` or `-o` option to set the download directory. If not specified, chapters will be downloaded to the current working directory.

*   **Launch GUI:**
    ```bash
    python cli.py gui
    ```
    This command launches the graphical user interface.

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)

The GUI provides a visual way to interact with the scraper.

To launch the GUI, run:
```bash
python gui.py
# Or via the CLI:
python cli.py gui
```

**GUI Features:**

*   **Convert to PDF Checkbox:** Enable this to convert downloaded chapters into PDF files.
*   **Convert to CBZ Checkbox:** Enable this to convert downloaded chapters into CBZ (comic book archive) files.
*   **Keep Images Checkbox:** Enable this (along with "Convert to PDF" or "Convert to CBZ") to keep original image files after conversion.

## Project Structure

*   `cli.py`:
    *   Implements the command-line interface using `Typer`.
    *   Provides commands for `info`, `search`, `list`, `download`, and `gui` (to launch the GUI).
    *   Uses `rich` for enhanced terminal output (panels, colors, progress bars).
    *   Orchestrates calls to functions in `bato_scraper.py`.

*   `gui.py`:
    *   Implements the graphical user interface using `CustomTkinter`.
    *   Provides input fields for URL and search queries, and buttons for various actions.
    *   Manages UI state, progress bar updates, and logging messages to a text area.
    *   Uses `threading` to perform scraping and download operations in the background, preventing the UI from freezing.
    *   Interacts with `bato_scraper.py` for core functionality.

*   `bato_scraper.py`:
    *   Contains the core logic for scraping Bato.to.
    *   `search_manga(query, max_pages)`: Searches for manga based on a query across multiple pages.
    *   `get_manga_info(series_url)`: Extracts the manga title and a list of chapters (title and URL) from a series page.
    *   `download_chapter(chapter_url, manga_title, chapter_title, output_dir, stop_event, convert_to_pdf, convert_to_cbz, keep_images, max_workers)`: Downloads all images for a given chapter with configurable threading, sanitizes titles for file paths, creates necessary directories, and saves images. Handles optional PDF and CBZ conversion.
    *   `convert_chapter_to_pdf(chapter_dir, delete_images)`: Converts a directory of images into a single PDF file.
    *   `convert_chapter_to_cbz(chapter_dir, delete_images)`: Converts a directory of images into a CBZ (comic book archive) file.
    *   `sanitize_filename(name)`: Sanitizes filenames to remove invalid Windows characters and normalize spaces.
    *   Uses `requests` for HTTP requests, `BeautifulSoup` for parsing HTML, and `ThreadPoolExecutor` for concurrent downloads.
    *   Includes comprehensive error handling for network requests, JSON parsing, and file operations.

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following Python libraries:

*   `typer`: For building the command-line interface.
*   `rich`: For beautiful terminal output in the CLI.
*   `customtkinter`: For creating the modern-looking graphical user interface.
*   `requests`: For making HTTP requests to Bato.to.
*   `beautifulsoup4`: For parsing HTML content and extracting data.
*   `Pillow`: For image processing and PDF creation.
*   `urllib.parse` (built-in): For URL encoding in search queries.

**Note:** CBZ conversion uses Python's built-in `zipfile` module, so no additional dependencies are required.

## Error Handling

Both the CLI and GUI include comprehensive error handling for network issues, invalid inputs, and file system operations. If an error occurs during fetching information or downloading, an appropriate message will be displayed in the console (CLI) or the output log/message box (GUI).

Common issues and tips:
*   **Invalid URL:** Ensure the Bato.to series URL is correct and accessible.
*   **Internet Connection:** Verify your internet connection if fetching or downloading fails.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Excessive requests might lead to temporary blocks. The scraper includes delays between requests to mitigate this.
*   **Windows Compatibility:** Folder names are automatically sanitized to remove invalid characters like `:`, `<`, `>`, etc.
*   **Threading Issues:** If downloads fail intermittently, try reducing the concurrent download settings in the GUI or CLI options.
*   **Disk Space:** Ensure sufficient disk space for downloads, especially when keeping images after conversion.
*   **Website Changes:** Bato.to's website structure might change, which could break the scraping logic. If the tool stops working, the scraping logic in `bato_scraper.py` might need updates.
